# Codependency

This is code-pendency, not co-dependency. Omg...

## About

Codependency is an April Fools' Day npm package that helps you identify and address unhealthy relationships between your JavaScript packages. Because sometimes your dependencies need therapy too!

## Features

- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies unhealthy relationships between your packages
- **Emotion Tracking**: Assigns emotional states to your dependencies in package.json
- **Relationship Therapy**: Interactive sessions to heal your project's dependency issues
- **Break-up Support**: Tools to help you say goodbye to toxic dependencies
- **Health Reports**: Assess your project's overall dependency wellness

## Installation

```bash
npm install codependency
```

## Usage

### Analyze your project's dependency relationships

```bash
npx codependency
```

### Start a therapy session for your packages

```bash
npm run therapy
```

## Therapy Options

- **Organize dependency intervention**: Confront your most controlling dependencies
- **Heal circular dependencies**: Break toxic cycles in your codebase
- **Work through version conflicts**: Help packages resolve their differences
- **Package emotion reassignment**: Give your packages healthier emotional states
- **Generate a dependency health report**: Get a holistic view of dependency wellness
- **Break up with toxic dependencies**: Say goodbye to packages that no longer serve you

## Package Emotional States

Your package.json will be enhanced with a new `codependencies` field that tracks the emotional state of each dependency:

```json
"codependencies": {
  "express": "needs-constant-validation",
  "react": "can't-make-decisions-without",
  "lodash": "obsessively-imports-everything",
  "moment": "terrified-of-being-deprecated"
}
```

## Happy April Fools' Day!

This package is intended as a humorous take on dependency management. While it won't actually solve your real dependency issues, it might make you laugh while thinking about them differently!

Remember: The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem with `npm install`.
